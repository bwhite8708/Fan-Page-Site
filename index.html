        <h2>Migos Bio, Life Story</h2>

        <p>Migos are a family affair. They are two cousins, Quavo, 26, and Offset, 25, and Quavo’s nephew Takeoff, who at 22 is just four years younger than his uncle. Purveyors of trap music, the bass-heavy Southern variant of hip hop, Migos are renowned for their distinctive offbeat “triplet” rhyming style — rapping to a frequency of just three beats in a standard 4/4 time signature — copied by Kanye West and Drake, among many others. Migos’ mixtapes and videos have been going viral — igniting global trends such as the dab, the head-dropped arm-bent dance — since 2013; now they have exploded into the mainstream.
         Migos is an American hip-hop group based in Atlanta, Georgia formed with the help of Trap Rapper & CEO Gucci Mane. The group consists of Quavo (real name Quavious Marshall, age 24), Takeoff (real name Kirshnik Ball, age 21) and Offset (real name Kiari Cephus, age 23). They rose to fame in 2013 following the arrival of their single "Versace".</p>

        <p>  On February 25, 2014, Migos released their new mixtape "No Label 2", which was downloaded over 100,000 times in the first week of its release and was certified gold on popular mixtape site DatPiff. "No Label 2" was met with generally positive reviews from music critics.</p>

        <p>  In June 2014, it was revealed that Migos had been signed to 300 Entertainment, which is distributed by Atlantic Records. Thy later released "Fight Night" which went on to become another hit for the group. It peaked at No. 69 on the Hot 100, making it the three rapper's most successful single to date.In April 2015, the group and some out their entourage members were arrested for possession of marijuana and a Schedule II drug, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime and possession of firearms by convicted felons on the day they're scheduled to headline Georgia Southern University's 2015 Spring concert at Hanner Fieldhouse.</p>

        <p>Several days after the arrest, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of the their entourage were released on bond by the Bulloch County District Attorney's Office while Offset and six others remained in custody without bond.

        Despite Offset remaining in custody, the group assured fans that their debut album "Yung Rich Nation" would still arrive on June 16. The LP was eventually pushed back to July 31.</P>

        <img src="img/mansion.jpg">

        <p>They moved to Quality Control Music because they felt that the new management could manage them alone and would increase revenue stream. In the same month, the three rappers released new mixtape titled "Back to the Bando". The first song off the mixtape, "Look at My Dab", was released on September 6. The song gained worldwide attention thanks in large part to the dance called "dabbing".</p>

        <p>In September 2016, the hip-hop group revealed their plans to release their long-awaited sophomore album called "Culture". Its lead single, "Bad and Boujee" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, was released on October 28. The song went viral after a large number of memes using the song lyrics surfaced. This phenomenon eventually caused the song to reach No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>

        <h2> Recent Activity,Quavos First Movie</h2>

        <p> The conversation turned to focus on the group's outside interests, with Offset explaining that Quavo is "writing the scripts" for what will be the Migos' first official foray into film.

        "I'm a '90s baby, and all my favorite movies got all the dope artists in them," Quavo says, namedropping which movies inspire him to get creative and try his hand at scriptwriting. "Juice, Menace II Society, all the Snoop Dogg movies, Master P movies, I Got The Hook-Up, Baller Blockin, Big Tymers movies. Even Ice Cube, Cube killed it. That's what we're doing right now; we're looking into the script."

        Additionally, during the sit-down, Quavo, the group's natural born leader, also explains that he is still working on his side-project with Travis Scott, adding that they are "still figuring it out with the music."</p>

        <p>Having grown up together in Atlanta, the members Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff first saw mainstream recognition with their 2013 single “Versace” (later remixed by Drake). In August 2016, Migos shared their song “Bad and Boujee” featuring Lil Uzi Vert—and, facilitated by memes and a shout-out from Donald Glover at the 2017 Golden Globes, the song leapt to No. 1 on the U.S. charts. Soon after, their sophomore album, Culture, debuted as a commercial and critical success.</p>

        <h2>Latest Collaberations</h2>

        <p>For the first single from their forthcoming Culture II, ascendant hip-hop trio Migos — who earlier this year went to No. 1 with their viral anthem “Bad and Boujee” — recruited two of the genre’s leading female artists: Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, fresh off a No. 1 turn of her own with “Bodak Yellow,” round out the new cut, “Motor Sport.”

        The single continues a banner year for all three artists. In addition to their “Bad and Boujee” success, Migos’ Culture debuted at No. 1 and the group’s members, Quavo, Offset, and Takeoff, have collaborated with a litany of other major artists. With “Bodak Yellow,” Cardi B dethroned Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” from the top of the Hot 100 and went on to set the record for most weeks at No. 1 by an unaccompanied female rapper. For her part, Minaj guested on Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish” and scored a moderate hit with her Drake and Lil Wayne collaboration “No Frauds,” which peaked at No. 14.</p>

        <h2>Net Worth
        Migos Net Worth 2017 – $3 Million

        How Did Migos Make their Money & Wealth?</h2>

        <p>This is not a hard one to figure out. If we ignore the possible favor verses then we are left with the same pillars of wealth as other hip hop artists. The aforementioned verse. The Album and the Single. Migos are more than rising stars at this point, but not quite superstars, if you know what i mean. So you see them collaborating all the time. The likes of Lil Uzi Vert can pull in $3000 for a verse, so I tend to use that as the base line figure to work from. They have appeared in well over 50 tracks as featured artists, which gives us a nice base to work from. Their album sales have been quite good too, with two full LP releases under their belts. The first, Yung Rich Nation peaked at number 17, which is far from terrible, but their most recent album, released in January of this year, shot to the number 1 spot in short order.</p>
